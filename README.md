===============================
This is my arcade game for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree


Gameplay:

1. Press enter to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to move.
3. The objective is to reach the top of the water and collect gems to score.
4. Each time you reach the top of the water, difficulty increases.
5. Collect hearts to gain extra lives.
5. Avoid the bugs, they kill you. You start with three lives.
